# DIABETES PREDICTION -APACHE SPARK 
The aim of this project is to create a model that can reliably predict the accuracy of diabetes in patients. 
The main aim of this project is to design and implement Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods and Performance Analysis of that methods and it has been achieved successfully.
Apache Spark is a data processing framework that can quickly perform processing tasks on very large data sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other distributed computing tools. These two qualities are key to the worlds of big data and machine learning,
